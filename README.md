When my friends and I wanted to play Snake & Ladder, we realized we didn’t have a dice 
So, I decided to quickly make a simple Dice Roller using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
Built With:-
HTML – for the basic structure.
CSS – for simple styling and animations.
JavaScript – for generating random dice numbers.
